# I have 60 folders in the path and each folder include a simulation_params.json file, 
# sort the folders based on the information in the simulation_params.json file.
# I have 'simulation condition', 'synaptic spatial condition', 'section type', 'distance from clusters to root' and 
# 'number of clusters' in the simulation_params.json file, and I want to sort the folders based on these 5 keys.
